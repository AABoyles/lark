Ten years ago next month the Huffington Post launched. 

Ultimately the site will probably be best known as the precursor to Buzzfeed, the place Jonah Peretti gained his first experience matching virality with scale. 

At its launch though, the Huffington Post made a splash for something else: namely, its deep roster of celebrity contributors, from the Seinfeld cast to sitting senators and congressmen. 

Then there was me.

To this day I don't know why I was included. I'd never met any of the founders, and  all I'd done to that point was graduate from college and start a modest blog. As far as I can tell I was just writing in the right place at the right time. 

All the same the invite felt like something momentous, the big break that would launch my career. And in a sense, it was. 

### A New (Media) World

For the first few months I tried my best to write for the site regularly. 

In the process I had three main realizations: 

1. **Journalists that failed to build personal brands would not remain journalists.** Even pre-Twitter, the stream format of HP made it clear that the combination of byline + profile pic would be everything. 

2. **Journalists that were not real-time would not remain journalists.** Again, the stream format -- and the volume of content flowing through just the one site alone -- made it clear that the news cycle had shrunk from days to hours. Staying relevant meant staying always-on.  

3. **Journalists that failed to be generalists would not remain journalists.** Once interest in the Huffington Post survived past the first few weeks, it seemed clear enough that digital was going to disrupt all the print monopolies, and the local / niche writers they supported.  

Obviously I knew those rules wouldn't be hard and fast. But I wasn't optimistic for the very long tail of writers that weren't unique enough to be exceptions to them. 

And increasingly I counted myself in that camp. When I looked at Ezra Klein or Matt Yglesias, the two young writers who grokked best what journalism was becoming, I realized pretty quickly that I wasn't going to replicate them. 

Even more though, I realized I didn't want to. Branded and always-on just wasn't who I was. 


### ENTER THE RELIGION &amp; POLITCS NICHE

For someone who had been on the fence about pursuing academia or journalism, the Huffington Post thus tipped the scales decisively. 

I soon applied to grad school. .... 

But it also made something else clear too: the value of expertise in an age when, to paraphrase David Winer, experts could go direct.
